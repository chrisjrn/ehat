# everyone has a Take

_Everyone Has a Take_ (EHAT) is a [presently theoretical] invitation-only afternoon tech event for the delivery of Takes, by people with Takes, in a Take-friendly environment. It is likely to take place somewhere in the Bay Area, and maybe slightly online.


## Rules

### You must have a Take

To attend, you must have a Take that you are willing to share in front of an audience. A Take can be a controversial opinion, an uncommon observation, or unexpected that will cause people to Think. A good rule of thumb is that a Take is a Take if you think at least one person in the audience will think you're completely wrong and will want to argue with you about it.

You must be willing to present your take for 30ish, 15ish, or 5ish minutes.

You'll be offered the opportunity to defend your Take against audience questions. You might have a greater chance of being offered a spot if you're willing to defend your Take, you might not, it will depend on what everyone else submits.


### Do not punch down

This hopefully goes without saying, but your Take may not punch down at underprivileged or marginalised people.


### No Take, no ticket*

Your Take might not get accepted as one that will be presented, but you won't get a ticket unless you submit a Take. You'll know a month in advance if you have to prepare your Take.

Every ticket will include a plus one, so you can bring a friend if you like.


## What/When

If I get enough takers (lol), I commit to putting this event on **sometime in August, somewhere in the San Francisco Bay Area**. If the first one goes well, I might run a second one.

We'll try to record videos. We may have live streaming in exchange for a donation to something worthy (why not ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).


## Preferred topics for our first event

* Open Source
* AI (generative)
* The intersection of the tech industry and society

Other topics are acceptable, but if we can pull together a theme/some themes, even better.


## Submit a Take

[OK here is a Google Form](https://forms.gle/6K3zLNkTDtYGcLr78). I'll probably seriously look at the responses around June 30th.

If you are averse to using Google Forms, [send us an email](mailto:takes@ehat.fyi) with answers to the following questions:

* Your name
* What is your take? (3-5 sentences)
* How long are you willing to present your Take for? (30ish/15ish/5ish minutes)
* Are you willing to defend your Take in the form of impromptu questions from the audience after your Take?
* How far north in the Bay Area are you willing to travel for this?
* How far south in the Bay Area are you willing to travel for this?
* Who can vouch for you? (in case you're unknown to the organiser)
* [Optional] Link us to some of your Greatest Hits (social media posts that got a response/talks that contain Takes/etc)
* [Optional] Do you have an idea for a venue that might work?


## Who/What

This is a concept of Christopher Neugebauer [@chrisjrn@social.coop](https://social.coop/@chrisjrn)/[@chrisjrn.fyi](https://bsky.app/profile/chrisjrn.fyi), who got nerdsniped into making this happen.

[You can email him](mailto:chrisjrn@ehat.fyi) with questions, or offers of material help to make this happen.
